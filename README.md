Description: The is a password generator that will give you a random password between 8-128 characters. You can select whether you would like to include lower case, upper case, numeric, and special characters.

How to use this: Click on the generate password button, and follow the prompts to select the number and type of characters you would like to have in your password. To generate a new password, refresh the page.

Why I built this: This was built as a homework assignment for my Full Stack Bootcamp

Cool JS Things: The concat functions that are additive across the different character selectors, the for loop to generate the correct number of characters based off the numChar variable. I realize most of these are pretty vanilla things, but I'm new to JS.
